## Hi there 👋
I'm hayden, a software QA engineer based in Japan.

I mostly work on QA testing stuff - iOS App, Android App .

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on. Everything here is built from scratch, no copy/paste templates.

Tools & Tech
- Swift (XCUI test)
- Kotlin (Compose UI test)

A Bit About Me
- Karate for 20 years
- I like building things that are simple, useful, and easy to understand
